<p> I'm a university student studying Physics and Computer Science with the intent of becoming a theoretical physicist.

<p>The underlying motivation behind this website is knowledge acquisition. The idea being, if I research a topic well enough to present it in article form I will have reached a certain level of understanding of the topic. Naturally, as time goes on, my thoughts and ideas about a subject will change and I'll update articles accordingly.</p>
 
<p>There are many topics that I want to explore and understand, my tendency is to see things through a theistic perspective, however, I recognize the value of viewing ideas from all angles, so I'll attempt to do so when the article premise requires it.</p>
 
<p>The Universe is eminently enigmatic, teeming with potential and abundant with the unknown. Every aspect of this reality is seemingly infinitely complex, from the largest galaxy to the smallest particle. It's all absolutely incredible and so fascinating to me. </p>

<p>Shoutout to Jesus for creating the Universe <br />
And for giving humanity the ultimate gift; salvation.<br />
(John 1:1-3) (Romans 6:23)</p>
